# olympics_history

This dataset includes the 120 year history of the olympics. It was a fun one to explore and scour. The data was obtained from kaggle here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results

I obtained insights from the data using SQL. A visualization dashboard was also created and hosted on Tableau, link here: https://public.tableau.com/views/SearchingOlympicsdata/Olympics?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
